# Amazon-EKS_Task

Create a Kubernetes cluster on the top of Public Cloud i.e. AWS.
They has an inbuilt service for these i.e. Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). 
This service internally creates & manages all the slave nodes. And then create a Kubernetes Deployment & deploy our website via K8S Deployment & make data persistent of that Deployment so that no data loss would be there & reflect the changes in code in real time.
